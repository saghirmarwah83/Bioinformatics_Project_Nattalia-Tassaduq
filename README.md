Nattalia Tassaduq 04032213033.This project focuses on the application of core bioinformatics tools to analyze a biological DNA sequence and extract meaningful genetic information. The workflow includes sequence retrieval, homology searching, open reading frame (ORF) identification, GC content analysis, repeat region detection, mRNA annotation, and basic phylogenetic interpretation. Through this systematic computational approach, the project demonstrates how raw nucleotide data can be transformed into biologically relevant insights regarding gene structure, function, and evolutionary relationships. The study highlights the importance of in-silico analysis in modern molecular biology and genomics research.NCBI BLAST n,ORF finder,Expasy,UTRscan,RNA fold,ProtParam,Pfam,PredictProten, Targetp,Psort,ClustalOmega, STRING.I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Samina Shakeel for her guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout the completion of this bioinformatics project. I am also thankful to the Department of Biochemistry for providing the necessary resources and learning environment.
